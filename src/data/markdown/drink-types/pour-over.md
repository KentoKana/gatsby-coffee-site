### What Is A Pour-Over?

To put it simply, pour-over is a coffee brewing method that involes pouring water over coffee grounds sitting on top of a coffee filter (hence the name *'pour-over'*). 

### Equipment

Typically, equipment used to brew pour-over coffee involves the following items:
* Required:
  * Filter
  * Dripper
  * Some container that the coffee can drip into.
  
* Optional (but strongly recommended):
  * Gooseneck kettle (you could use any kettle really, but having a gooseneck kettle will make your life A LOT easier.)
  * Coffee grinder (if you don't have pre-ground coffee).
  * A scale (to measure the amount of coffee grounds, as well as the amount of water being poured.)
  * Timer

### Why Pour-Over?

Pour-over is one of the most popular ways of brewing coffee amongst coffee enthusiasts. One of the reasons is because pour-over provides you with a lot of control over each step of the brewing method. From coffee beans to water ratio, temperature of the water, the coarse-ness of the ground, and the rate at which the water soaks the coffee ground - pour over provides you with precision that you just can't get with typical coffee machines. 

The fact is, every coffee bean you buy tastes different, based on where the coffee comes from, how it was farmed, when it was farmed, how it was roasted ... etc. In order to enjoy the unique tastes of the beans, you need a brewing method that gives you flexible control over the factors that affect the taste.
